# Goal: Less than 57 files

In the prototype snapshot, there are 23 decorator modules and 34 structure modules.  This is a lot, all implementing the various structures from ts-morph.d.ts.

I want to generate as much of the source code as possible, from less modules in the build directory.  In theory this should be possible.
